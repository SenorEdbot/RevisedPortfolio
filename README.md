## Welcome! 

### Projects
Please feel free to browse through my projects here on GibHub. The links on the portfolio page will take you directly to them.  
Below is a brief summary about my projects.
* Unit-4-Game
    * A small role playing game. You'll be able to select a character and then fight the remaining defenders until they win or you win. 
* Trivia Game
    * A trivia game all about Eminem. Give it a try, its harder than you think! With this project I demonstrate the ability to user timeouts to allow the game to progress with no next button.
* Giftastic
    * This project allows the user to search gifs. Initially they will have 15 different sports to choose from with the option to add any search term they want. 
    * Favorites button. The 'Add Fav' button will allow users to keep their favorite gifs even if they search for another term. 
* Project 1 - Open Roaders
    * Alex and I created an website that solved the age old problem: **Planning a road trip is hard!**
    * This website allows users to:
        * Retrieve the 5 day forecast for their starting and ending location. 
        * Retrieve trip metrics, including fuel cost, mileage, and trip timing. 
        * Allows users to see their trip on a Google Maps functional map. 
        * Users may drag pins around if they change their mind later. 
        * *This website will find the most efficient route for up to 23 waypoints not including the start and end address*
